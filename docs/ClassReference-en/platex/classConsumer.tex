Placeholder template class to hold remote object reference.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$CorbaConsumer.h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
Placeholder template class to hold remote object reference. This class holds a type of object that given by template parameter. For internal use, \_\-ptr type and \_\-var type should be given as template parameter. (Please refere the following notation.)

Note: ObjectTypePtr's default value is defined as ObjectType::\_\-ptr\_\-type, although \_\-ptr\_\-type is not defined as normative type. However, omniORB, TAO, MICO, ORBit, ORBacus define \_\-ptr\_\-type and \_\-var\_\-type as \_\-ptr type and \_\-var type in stub code. Usually, you don't need to specify 2nd and 3rd template arguments.
